The SIP_Creator folder is not included in this Git repository.

You can download it from the Preservica website, the user group or the web interface of the SAAS environment. Be sure to download
version 5.10, as 5.11 does not seem to work (as found on february 1, 2021).

After downloading and extracting it, rename the folder "SIP Creator" into "SIP_Creator" (i.e., no space in the name).

IMPORTANT:
The shell script createsip is not used. A modified copy (nha-createsip) is part of the XSLWeb sipcreator webapp. This
copy is used instead.

In case of new versions, compare nha-createsip with the original Preservica version and adapt if needed.
